# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issue: No Output on Frontend Due to AI API Errors

### Problems Identified:

1. **OpenAI API Quota Exceeded**: The main issue causing no output was OpenAI API calls failing with quota/rate limit errors
2. **Search Validation Errors**: Empty query strings were being sent to search API, causing validation failures
3. **No Error Recovery**: No fallback mechanism when primary AI provider fails

### Fixes Implemented:

#### 1. AI Model Manager Enhanced Error Handling (`src/server/lib/ai-model-manager.ts`)
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Implemented proper error classification (quota vs other errors)
- Added jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Provide user-friendly error messages

#### 2. AI Chat Router Provider Fallback (`src/server/api/routers/ai-chat.ts`)
- Implemented automatic fallback to alternative providers when primary fails
- Priority order: Original choice → Google Gemini → Anthropic Claude
- Enhanced error messages for better user experience
- Returns which provider was actually used in response

#### 3. Search API Validation Fix (`src/server/api/routers/search.ts`)
- Removed minimum length requirement for search queries
- Added proper handling for empty/null queries
- Fixed cosine similarity function for semantic search

#### 4. Command Palette Search Optimization (`src/components/command-palette.tsx`)
- Only triggers search API when query has actual content
- Prevents unnecessary API calls with empty queries
- Reduces server load and error logs

### Result:
- No more empty query validation errors
- Graceful handling of API quota issues with automatic fallback
- Better user experience with informative error messages
- Improved reliability and resilience of the AI chat system

### Test the Fixes:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try sending a message in the chat
3. If OpenAI quota is exceeded, system will automatically fallback to Google Gemini or Anthropic
4. Search functionality will work without validation errors
5. Users will see helpful error messages instead of silent failures
